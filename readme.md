# Atom One Light Theme for Jupyter Lab

Inspired by [VSCode Atom One Light](https://github.com/akamud/vscode-theme-onelight) which is base on [Atom's One Light theme](https://github.com/atom/one-light-syntax).

This project is under development. Many styles are not finished yet. Only test JupyterLab 3.2.8 in Chrome 79 and Edge 79.
